# titantutorial
This git repository is designed to accompany the Rose-Hulman Titan Tutorial for connecting
to a MSSQL Server.

Included are the bash functions developed during the tutorial.

To run sqlrun use the utility 'sh'

```bash
sh sqlrun.sh
```

This will save the output of the query to the file output.html

To find this output then display it on the browser instead run

```bash
sh sqlrundisplay.sh
```
